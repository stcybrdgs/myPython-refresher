# stack.py
'''
-  stacks are a LIFO structure that support push() and pop()
-  queues are a FIFO structure that support enqueing and dequeing
-  push/pop and enque/deque are constant time operations
-  stacks and queues are fundamental structures with broad practical applications
   in software development

-  STACK EXAMPLES:
-    one example of using a stack would be to evaluate a mathematical expression
     using reverse Polish notation
-    another example of using a stack is to provide a backtracking feature, such
     as when you follow links in your browser; if you push each link onto a stack,
     then backtracking just requires a pop()
-  QUEUE EXAMPLES:	 
-    an example of using a queue is order processing because the FIFO queue ensures
     that orders will be filled in the order that they are received
-    another example of using a queue is message processing
