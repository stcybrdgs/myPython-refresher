'''
- merge sort is a 'divide and conquer' algorithm-- ie, it breaks data down into
  smaller parts that are easier to work with.
- it uses recursion to perform sorting
- generally performs better than merge sort O(n log n)
- performs data sorting in place and doesn't need extra memory to do its work
- worst case scenario occurs on a fully sorted or mostly sorted list, in which case
  the performance can occasionally degrade to quadratic time complexity O(n^2)
- to do quicksort, your algorithm needs to start by finding the pivot point
